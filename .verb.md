<summary><strong>What does this do?</strong></summary>

Used by [prompt-base][] for toggling choices and updating the pointer position on prompts. 

This is a separate module so that it is easier to maintain and unit test, and so that it can also be used by custom prompts when needed.

## Usage

Add this library to your custom [prompt][base-prompt] with the following line of code:

```js
var Actions = require('{%= name %}');
```
